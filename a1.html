    <p>A space station, such as the International Space Station (ISS), is a spacecraft in orbit that provides a place for humans to live and work for extended periods, primarily serving as a microgravity research laboratory. The ISS is an international project involving multiple countries and space agencies, including NASA and Roscosmos, and is assembled in orbit from modules.</p>

    <p>Moon mission information includes the historic Apollo missions, like Apollo 11 which first landed humans on the Moon in 1969, and the current Artemis program, aiming to return humans to the Moon, starting with Artemis II (a crewed lunar flyby) and Artemis III (a crewed landing). Other nations, including China and India, have also sent uncrewed missions to the Moon, with India's Chandrayaan-3 successfully landing near the south pole in 2023.</p>
